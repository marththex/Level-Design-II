Begrudged
Game Title: Begrudged
Players: 2-4
Estimated Play Length: 15-20 minutes
Group Name: DPSF (Derek Prate’s Space Force)
Overview: Begrudged is a semi-cooperative game where players build the map as they explore a derelict space station, attempting to flee the horrors that lurk within. As players leave the starting room, they reveal and add new rooms to the map that contain enemies and gear. Players are searching for two key cards that will allow them to access the escape pods and win. 
Basic Rules
Movement: As exploring a dangerous dungeon full of cosmic beasts is rather difficult, players will use the gear, grudge cards and roll a digital die (like in Mario party) to move.
Gear: Players will pick up various gear, equipment, and weapons to use as they explore and fight the monsters and each other.
Combat: Using weapons they find, or grudges they build, players will fight the monsters onboard and compete with the other players.
Grudges: Players use grudges on each other to hinder or help other players, fueling other players’ ability to use grudges on other players.
